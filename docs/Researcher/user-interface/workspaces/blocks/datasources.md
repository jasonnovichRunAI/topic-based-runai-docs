# Data source introduction

 
A _data source_ is a location where data sets relevant to the research are stored. Workspaces can be attached to several data sources for reading and writing. The data can be located locally or in the cloud. Run:ai data sources can use a variety of storage technologies such as Git, S3, NFS, PVC, and more.  

The data source is an __optional__ building block for the creation of a workspace.
